## I'm Ataf. Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹
I am a CSE Graduate from BUET, currently living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. I work as a Secure Software Developer at [OpenRefactory](www.openrefactory.com) in collaboration with [OpenSSF](github.com/ossf) on [Project Alpha Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/). In this project, we find and fix bugs in open source software projects. For a detailed information, you can have a look at my [Open Source Software (OSS) Bug Fixing Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vT41_0Td-dXXsu9Uu0lKpZP_pLnyNCjR6sL13I_VSXp0_5WusgzCgZkkbC1LWMvogB5s0wEVnCvTLOn/pubhtml)


## Apart From That
I used to take part in CTFs, hackathons, and business competitions. Our team 'Fsociety' came up as the 2nd runners' up in National Cyber Drill 2022. Another team of mine- 'Team CCDCEDC' of reached the finals of Battle Of Minds 2022 and had to withdraw due to our academic reasons. Currently, I'm focusing in the Computer Security domain. I am mostly interested in cloud and software security.
